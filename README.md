# web-api-server

A simple Webmachine server that, for now, serves static HTML pages to the
[web-api-client](https://github.com/statonjr/web-api-client) as part
of an exercise in using HTML as hypermedia as shown in
[Jon Moore's presentation](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/web-api-html).

## Installation

Gems are vendored, as they should be, so:

`bundle install --local`

## Running

`bundle exec puma`
